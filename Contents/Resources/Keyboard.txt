#	a comment line must begin with a pound sign (#), blank lines are ignored

#	modifier keys are as follows
#	c = control key
#	s = shift key
#	a = alt key

#	they may come in any order, eg: "asc" is the same as "csa"
#	they must be followed by a dash character, eg: -

# you can have NO modifier keys, in which case you just use the dash by itself, see examples below
#	that is followed by the UNMODIFIED version of the key you want to use
#	ie: if you want shift-S then specify "s-s", not "s-S"
#	ergo: you can not use keys which require shifting, controlling, or alting
#	eg: the @ sign is not legal (shift 2 on US keyboards), but you can use "s-2"

# the delimiter between menu name and shortcut MUST be "quote space equals space quote", the 
# parser is NOT tolerant of white space (no extra spaces, no tabs)

# virtual keys are also supported, see:
# http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd375731%28v=VS.85%29.aspx
# to use them you must enter the hex value associated with it, eg: for the left arrow, you will
# see VK_LEFT = 0x25, so use "-0x25" 

# the following table adds to the default existing shortcuts.  
# to *remove* a shortcut from the default, just enter a 
# blank line, eg: to remove the "New Playlist" Ctrl-N, do this:
# "Menu/File/New Playlist" = "-"
# then you can use Ctrl-N somewhere else.  (this is not recommended)

# lines must end with a semi-colon: ;
